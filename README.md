# Tears



##

**[Intro]**

Mm


Mm, hmm (Ah-ha)

Uh (Shikitah)

#

**[Chorus]**

I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)

Being a responsible guy (Shikitah)

Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)

Tears run down my thighs


#

**[Verse 1]**

A little initiative can go a very long, long way

Baby, just do the dishes,

I'll give you what you (What you),

what you want

A little communication,

yes, that's my ideal foreplay

Assemble a chair from IKEA

I'm like, "Uh~" (Ah!)

#

**[Chorus]**

I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)


Being a responsible guy (So responsible, shikitah)

Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)

Tears run down my thighs

#

**[Verse 2]**

A little respect for women can get you very, very far

Remembering how to use your phone gets me oh, so (Oh, so),

oh, so hot

Considering I have feelings, I'm like, "Why are my clothes still on?"

Offering to do anything, I'm like (Uh~), "Oh my god!"

#

**[Chorus]**

I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)

Being a responsible guy (So responsible, shikitah)

Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)

Tears run down my thighs

#

**[Post-Chorus]**

I get wet at the thought of you (I get)

Being a responsible guy (So, so, so, responsible guy)

Treating me like you're supposed to do (Supposed to do)

Tears run down my thighs (Dance break)

#

**[Bridge]**

Oh

So responsible

No

#

**[Chorus]**

I get wet at the thought of you (Uh-huh)

Being a responsible guy (Guy, so responsible, shikitah)

Treating me like you're supposed to do (Uh-huh)

Tears run down both my thighs (Shikitah)
